# jcfResizeText
JavaScript function to resize text to fit within container

## Usage

Include the script found at `/public/assets/js/jcfResizeText.js` to your web page.

Add the class `.jcfResize` to any elements containing text which you want to be rescaled when the page is resized.

If you do not wish for text to be resized when the page loads initially, comment out the line:

```
jcfResizeText();
```
located directly before the event listener.
